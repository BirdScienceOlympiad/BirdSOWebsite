		<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
		<p>The Mini tournament will be run in the mini SO format, described in the Rules Manual. Students must compete from their homes and may not meet up in-person. In addition, our tournament is asynchronous; teams can participate in any of the events at any given 50-minute interval during the duration of the competition (December 11–18, 2021). Teams from the same school are encouraged to take tests at the same time to ensure academic integrity.</p>

		<h2 id="events">Events</h2>
		<p>The event slate for the Satellite Tournament features twenty-two official events, five trial events, and five Computer Science Initiative events. Events will try to follow the official Rules Manual; however, some modifications may be necessary to adapt to our virtual format. Competitors are encouraged to review sections of the Event Modifications documents relevant to their events prior to the tournament.</p>
