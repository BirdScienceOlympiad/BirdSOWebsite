		<p>BirdSO's inagural tournament, first announced in early December 2020, took place virtually in the mini SO format from March 7â€“13, 2021.

		<h2 id="events">Events</h2>
		<p>The events slate featured twenty-one official events and six trial events in each division. As the tournament took place in the mini SO format, details about event modifcations used to adapt events to a virtual experience were provided to all teams ahead of the tournament. All testing for events took place on the <a href="https://scilympiad.com/birdso">Scilympiad</a> platform, and many events with device testing included video components. Alongside these modifications, policies detailing expectations for academic honesty as well as what resources would be allowed were implemented.</p>
