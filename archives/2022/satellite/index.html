		<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
		<p>The Satellite Tournament was run in the Satellite SO format, described in the Rules Manual. Students competed at their schools under the supervision of their coaches. In addition, our tournament was asynchronous; teams could participate in any of the events at any given 50-minute interval during the duration of the competition (February 12–19, 2022). Teams from the same school were encouraged to take tests at the same time to ensure academic integrity.</p>

		<h2 id="events">Events</h2>
		<p>The event slate for the Satellite Tournament featured twenty-two official events, five trial events, and five Computer Science Initiative events. Events tried to follow the official Rules Manual; however, some modifications were necessary to adapt to our virtual format. Competitors were encouraged to review sections of the Event Modifications documents relevant to their events prior to the tournament.</p>

		<p><b>Computer Science (CS) Initiative:</b> Considering the increasing prevalence of Computer Science both as a specialized skill and as a tool used across education and science careers, BirdSO supplemented the Science Olympiad event slate with five additional events that we hoped would help offer additional avenues to explore this burgeoning field. For Division B, we ran Code Analysis, Cybersecurity, Game On, Run It Code It, and Spreadsheet Scripting. For Division C, we ran Bioinformatics, Cybersecurity, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Run It Code It. Many of these events were developed with the help of our BirdSO team and were also run at the 2022 National Tournament. We were excited to help facillitate the debut of these events during the 2021–2022 season!</p>

		<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>
