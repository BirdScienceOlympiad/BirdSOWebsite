		<p><b>The BirdSO Mini Invitational for Divisions B and C ran from December 11–18, 2021. Featuring nineteen official events and five trial events, the tournament took place in a virtual format where students competed from the comfort of their own homes.

		<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
		<p>The Mini tournament was run in the mini SO format, described in the Rules Manual. Students competed from their homes and could not meet up in-person. In addition, our tournament was asynchronous; teams could participate in any of the events at any given 50-minute interval during the duration of the competition (December 11–18, 2021). Teams from the same school were encouraged to take tests at the same time to ensure academic integrity.</p>

		<h2 id="events">Events</h2>
		<p>The event slate for the Mini Tournament featured nineteen official events and five trial events. Events tried to follow the official Rules Manual; however, some modifications were necessary to adapt to our virtual format. Competitors were encouraged to review sections of the Event Modifications documents relevant to their events prior to the tournament.</p>
