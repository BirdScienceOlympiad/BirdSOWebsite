		<p>Thank you for your interest in competing in the BirdSO Invitationals! This year, we will be hosting two Division B/C tournaments, an in-person tournament and a <a href="/satellite/">Satellite Tournament</a>. The Division B In-Person Tournament, which will take place at Rio Hondo College, will be on January 14th, 2023. The Division C In-Person tournament, which will take place at Temple City High School, will be on January 28th, 2023. The Satellite Tournament, which takes place at your school under the supervision of your coach, will run February 11–18, 2023.</p>
		<p class="indent"><b>Mini Tournament: December 11–18, 2021<br>Satellite Tournament: February 12–19, 2022</b></p>
		<p>Regardless of which tournament format you choose to participate in, we strive to deliver the same high quality competition experience for which BirdSO is known.</p>

		<h2 id="register">Register</h2>
		<p><b>Registration for both tournaments will open on October 14th, 2022 @ Noon PT. All teams registering after we have reached capacity will be placed on a waitlist for that tournament.</b></p>
		<!-- <p>To register, please have your coach fill out the Google Form linked below that corresponds to the tournament(s) you are interested in.
