		<p>Thank you for your interest in competing in the BirdSO Invitationals! This year, we will be hosting two Division B/C tournaments, a <a href="/birdso/mini/">Mini Tournament</a> and a <a href="/birdso/satellite/">Satellite Tournament</a>. The Mini Tournament, which takes place from the comfort of your own home, will run from December 11–18, 2021. The Satellite Tournament, which takes place at your school under the supervision of your coach, will run February 12–19, 2022.</p>
		<p class="indent"><b>Mini Tournament: December 11–18, 2021<br>Satellite Tournament: February 12–19, 2022</b></p>
		<p>Regardless of which tournament format you choose to participate in, we strive to deliver the same high quality competition experience for which BirdSO is known.</p>
